# Getting Started

## Using THORChain

THORChain offers a suite of decentralized and permissionless services:

1. [Swapping](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/swapping) cross-chain between native assets, e.g. from native BTC (on the Bitcoin blockchain) to native ETH (on the Ethereum blockchain).

2. [Savings](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/savings) with native assets, e.g. native BTC, and earning yield paid in the same native assets.

3. [Lending](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/lending) out native assets, e.g. native BTC, as collateral to take out over-collateralized loans in any native assets, e.g. native BTC or native ETH.

4. [Liquidity Pools (LPs)](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/liquidity-providers): Depositing native assets, e.g. native BTC, to provide liquidity asymmetrically.

\*THORChain does NOT currently support Taproot addresses (BTC, LTC or otherwise).

For all the above services, users do not need to hold (or even be aware of) the RUNE token. They just need to choose from a plethora of [Frontend User Interfaces](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#exchanges-only) (Wallets and Exchanges) to interact with THORChain. For instructions, troubleshooting and support, please contact the respective User Interfaces support channels.

## Interacting with the RUNE token

The [RUNE](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/rune) token is the native asset on THORChainâ€™s own sovereign blockchain. Users who want to hold RUNE, deposit into LPs symmetrically, and/or [bonding](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/node-operators) into nodes, will need a wallet which can hold RUNE. Check here for a [list of wallets which support RUNE](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#integrated-wallets-and-exchanges).

Users can swap for RUNE, from THORChain directly, using any of the [Frontend User Interfaces](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#exchanges-only); or acquire from supported centralized exchanges.
