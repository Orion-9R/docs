# IBC

The Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. Chains that speak IBC can share any type of data as long as it's encoded in bytes, enabling the industryâ€™s most feature-rich cross-chain interactions. IBC is secure and permissionless.
