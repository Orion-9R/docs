# Fullnode

The term fullnode describes a basic setup of a synced THORNode daemon and optionally Midgard and is meant to provide API endpoints for private or public use. Because the THORNode doesn't take part in the chains consensus other chain clients aren't needed.

See [Overview](../overview.md) for more information about the different node types.

{% hint style="info" %}

The installation guides for running a fullnode via Docker or directly on Linux are not officially supported by the development team. The preferred and supported way is by using [Kubernetes](thornode-kubernetes.md).
