# Bridge Assets

{% hint style="info" %}
This is subject to change as details get worked out. This is not yet implemented. \
See the [Dev Discord](https://discord.com/channels/838986635756044328/1276645235560284260) and [Gitlab MR](https://gitlab.com/thorchain/thornode/-/merge\_requests/3711) for more detailed information.

Also see [Technology](../technology/) for generic Cosmos information. What notation will they have?
{% endhint %}

The plan is for the [delimiter](../frequently-asked-questions/asset-types.md) to be a dash '-'. \
E.g. `ETH.ETH` is L1. `ETH-ETH` will be a bridged asset.&#x20;

While ETH.tc is pictured, that may change to `ETH-ETH`.

## What will Bridge Assets look like?
